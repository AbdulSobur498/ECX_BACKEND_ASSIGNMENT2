        <p>My name is Bello Abdusobur. I am currently learning backend development at the ECX trainning, I choose the backend track because I have passion for building scalabe and secured systems that powered web and mobile application, And another reason is that Backend requires logic things and i like things that challenges the brain</p>
        <p> Back-end development is the area of web development focused on all of the necessary background processes occurring at the "server side" of websites, web apps, and mobile apps.</p>
